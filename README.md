## Analysis and Optimization of efficient system of hydrogen production through ammonia thermal decomposition to achieve carbon-free emission using UNISIM DESIGN

Today, We face global challenges like climate crisis. So We need to clear and renewable energy source which doesn't emit carbon dioxide or air pollutant.

Those reason, Our team assigned the efficient system for produce hydrogen without carbon-energy source.

We design 3 case of process to optimize the system using case study function in UNISIM

The NOx generating during the process is removed by using SCR(Selective Catalysts Reduction)
